1. **Pre-trained model vs chatbot model**
The outcome of pre-training is a model that tries to predict the next word, as if the text appeared somewhere on the internet.
This is not the same as having a helpful chatbot, which is why there are extra steps (like scaffolding, fine tuning or RLHF).
This page allows you to send text to both types of models and explicitly see the difference.
